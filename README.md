This is a simple web scraper that fetches content from https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills and outputs information in json format like below.

{
  "title": "Senate Bill 1 â€¢ Water matters.",
  "sponsors": ["Sen. Eric Koch", "Sen. Chris Garten", "Sen. Susan Glick"],

  "source": "https://iga.in.gov/legislative/2025/bills/senate/1/details"
}
